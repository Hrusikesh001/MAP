**🚀 Real-Time GPS Tracking**
"Pinpoint your location anytime, anywhere"


Real-Time GPS Tracking is a static website that utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display a map and track user locations in real-time. This project is designed to demonstrate the capabilities of WebSockets and Leaflet.js in creating a dynamic and interactive mapping experience.
The website allows users to share their location with others and view the locations of other users on a shared map. The map is centered on India by default, but users can zoom in and out to view locations worldwide. The website also includes a feature to update the user's location periodically, allowing for real-time tracking.

**✨ Features**

1. **Real-time Location Tracking**: Users can share their location with others, and view the locations of other users on a shared map.
2. **Map Zooming and Panning**: Users can zoom in and out to view locations worldwide, and pan the map to view different areas.
3. **User Location Updates**: The website updates the user's location periodically, allowing for real-time tracking.
4. **WebSocket Connection**: The website establishes a WebSocket connection with the server, enabling real-time communication between the client and server.
5. **Leaflet.js Integration**: The website uses Leaflet.js to create an interactive and customizable map.
6. **Customizable Map Style**: Users can customize the map style by adding markers, changing the map background, and more.
7. **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to be responsive, ensuring a smooth user experience on desktop and mobile devices.
8. **Error Handling**: The website includes error handling mechanisms to ensure that the user experience is not disrupted in the event of errors or connectivity issues.
